    _local_rsync_password: ${2:# Internal use only, never logged}
    _local_rsync_path: ${3:# Internal use only}
    _ssh_args: ${4:# Internal use only}
    _substitute_controller: ${5:# Internal use only}
    archive: ${6:# Mirrors the rsync archive flag, enables recursive, links, perms, times, owner, group flags, and C(-D)}
    checksum: ${7:# Skip based on checksum, rather than mod-time & size; Note that that O(archive) option is still enabled by default - the O(checksum) option will not disable it}
    compress: ${8:# Compress file data during the transfer}
    copy_links: ${9:# Copy symlinks as the item that they point to (the referent) is copied, rather than the symlink}
    delay_updates: ${10:# This option puts the temporary file from each updated file into a holding directory until the end of the transfer, at which time all the files are renamed into place in rapid succession}
    delete: ${11:# Delete files in O(dest) that do not exist (after transfer, not before) in the O(src) path}
    dest: ${12:# Path on the destination host that will be synchronized from the source}
    dest_port: ${13:# Port number for ssh on the destination host}
    dirs: ${14:# Transfer directories without recursing}
    existing_only: ${15:# Skip creating new files on receiver}
    group: ${16:# Preserve group}
    link_dest: ${17:# Add a destination to hard link against during the rsync}
    links: ${18:# Copy symlinks as symlinks}
    mode: ${19:# Specify the direction of the synchronization}
    owner: ${20:# Preserve owner (super user only)}
    partial: ${21:# Tells rsync to keep the partial file which should make a subsequent transfer of the rest of the file much faster}
    perms: ${22:# Preserve permissions}
    private_key: ${23:# Specify the private key to use for SSH-based rsync connections (e}
    recursive: ${24:# Recurse into directories}
    rsync_opts: ${25:# Specify additional rsync options by passing in an array}
    rsync_path: ${26:# Specify the rsync command to run on the remote host}
    rsync_timeout: ${27:# Specify a C(--timeout) for the rsync command in seconds}
    set_remote_user: ${28:# Put C(user@) for the remote paths}
    src: ${29:# Path on the source host that will be synchronized to the destination}
    ssh_connection_multiplexing: ${30:# SSH connection multiplexing for rsync is disabled by default to prevent misconfigured ControlSockets from resulting in failed SSH connections}
    times: ${31:# Preserve modification times}
    use_ssh_args: ${32:# In Ansible 2}
    verify_host: ${33:# Verify destination host key}
