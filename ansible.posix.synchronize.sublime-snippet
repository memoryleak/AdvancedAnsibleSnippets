  ansible.posix.synchronize:
    src: ${2:# Path on the source host that will be synchronized to the destination}
    dest: ${3:# Path on the destination host that will be synchronized from the source}
    dest_port: ${4:# Port number for ssh on the destination host}
    mode: ${5:# Specify the direction of the synchronization}
    archive: ${6:# Mirrors the rsync archive flag, enables recursive, links, perms, times, owner, group flags and -D}
    checksum: ${7:# Skip based on checksum, rather than mod-time & size; Note that that 'archive' option is still enabled by default - the 'checksum' option will not disable it}
    compress: ${8:# Compress file data during the transfer}
    existing_only: ${9:# Skip creating new files on receiver}
    delete: ${10:# Delete files in I(dest) that do not exist (after transfer, not before) in the I(src) path}
    dirs: ${11:# Transfer directories without recursing}
    recursive: ${12:# Recurse into directories}
    links: ${13:# Copy symlinks as symlinks}
    copy_links: ${14:# Copy symlinks as the item that they point to (the referent) is copied, rather than the symlink}
    perms: ${15:# Preserve permissions}
    times: ${16:# Preserve modification times}
    owner: ${17:# Preserve owner (super user only)}
    group: ${18:# Preserve group}

    use_ssh_args: ${22:# In Ansible 2}
    ssh_connection_multiplexing: ${23:# SSH connection multiplexing for rsync is disabled by default to prevent misconfigured ControlSockets from resulting in failed SSH connections}
    rsync_opts: ${24:# Specify additional rsync options by passing in an array}
    partial: ${25:# Tells rsync to keep the partial file which should make a subsequent transfer of the rest of the file much faster}
    verify_host: ${26:# Verify destination host key}
    private_key: ${27:# Specify the private key to use for SSH-based rsync connections (e}
    link_dest: ${28:# Add a destination to hard link against during the rsync}
    delay_updates: ${29:# This option puts the temporary file from each updated file into a holding directory until the end of the transfer, at which time all the files are renamed into place in rapid succession}
