    delayed_acks: ${2:# When C(true), the system sends fewer than one ACK segment per data segment received}
    early_retransmit: ${3:# When C(true), the system uses early fast retransmits to reduce the recovery time for connections that are receive-buffer or user-data limited}
    idle_timeout: ${4:# Specifies the length of time a connection is idle (has no traffic) before the connection is eligible for deletion}
    initial_congestion_window_size: ${5:# Specifies the initial congestion window size for connections to this destination}
    initial_receive_window_size: ${6:# Specifies the initial receive window size for connections to this destination}
    ip_tos_to_client: ${7:# Specifies the L3 Type of Service level the system inserts in TCP packets destined for clients}
    keep_alive_interval: ${8:# Specifies how frequently the system sends data over an idle TCP connection, to determine whether the connection is still valid}
    nagle: ${9:# When C(enabled) the system applies Nagle's algorithm to reduce the number of short segments on the network}
    name: ${10:# Specifies the name of the profile}
    parent: ${11:# Specifies the profile from which this profile inherits settings}
    partition: ${12:# Device partition to manage resources on}
    provider: ${13:# A dict object containing connection details}
    proxy_options: ${14:# When C(true), the system advertises an option, such as a time-stamp, to the server only if it was negotiated with the client}
    state: ${15:# When C(present), ensures the profile exists}
    syn_rto_base: ${16:# Specifies the initial RTO C(Retransmission TimeOut) base multiplier for SYN retransmission, in C(milliseconds)}
    time_wait_recycle: ${17:# Specifies connections in a TIME-WAIT state are reused if a SYN packet (indicating a request for a new connection) is received}
    time_wait_timeout: ${18:# Specifies the number of milliseconds a connection is in the TIME-WAIT state before closing}
