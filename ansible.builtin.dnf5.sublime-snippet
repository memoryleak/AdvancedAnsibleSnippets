    best: ${5:# When set to V(true), either use a package with the highest version available or fail}
    bugfix: ${6:# If set to V(true), and O(state=latest) then only installs updates that have been marked bugfix related}
    cacheonly: ${7:# Tells dnf to run entirely from system cache; does not download or update metadata}
    conf_file: ${8:# The remote dnf configuration file to use for the transaction}
    disable_excludes: ${9:# Disable the excludes defined in DNF config files}
    disable_gpg_check: ${10:# Whether to disable the GPG checking of signatures of packages being installed}

    exclude: ${17:# Package name(s) to exclude when O(state=present) or O(state=latest)}
    install_repoquery: ${18:# This is effectively a no-op in DNF as it is not needed with DNF}

    list: ${21:# Various (non-idempotent) commands for usage with C(/usr/bin/ansible) and I(not) playbooks}
