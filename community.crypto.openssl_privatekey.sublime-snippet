  community.crypto.openssl_privatekey:
    attributes: ${2:# The attributes the resulting filesystem object should have}
    backup: ${3:# Create a backup file including a timestamp so you can get the original private key back if you overwrote it with a new one by accident}
    cipher: ${4:# The cipher to encrypt the private key}
    curve: ${5:# Note that not all curves are supported by all versions of C(cryptography)}
    force: ${6:# Should the key be regenerated even if it already exists}
    format: ${7:# Determines which format the private key is written in}
    format_mismatch: ${8:# Determines behavior of the module if the format of a private key does not match the expected format, but all other parameters are as expected}
    group: ${9:# Name of the group that should own the filesystem object, as would be fed to C(chown)}
    mode: ${10:# The permissions the resulting filesystem object should have}
    owner: ${11:# Name of the user that should own the filesystem object, as would be fed to C(chown)}
    passphrase: ${12:# The passphrase for the private key}
    path: ${13:# Name of the file in which the generated TLS/SSL private key will be written}
    regenerate: ${14:# Allows to configure in which situations the module is allowed to regenerate private keys}
    return_content: ${15:# If set to V(true), will return the (current or generated) private key's content as RV(privatekey)}
    select_crypto_backend: ${16:# Determines which crypto backend to use}
    selevel: ${17:# The level part of the SELinux filesystem object context}
    serole: ${18:# The role part of the SELinux filesystem object context}
    setype: ${19:# The type part of the SELinux filesystem object context}
    seuser: ${20:# The user part of the SELinux filesystem object context}
    size: ${21:# Size (in bits) of the TLS/SSL key to generate}
    state: ${22:# Whether the private key should exist or not, taking action if the state is different from what is stated}
    type: ${23:# The algorithm used to generate the TLS/SSL private key}
    unsafe_writes: ${24:# Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem object}
